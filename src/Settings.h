 * What kind of error checking should be used.
 * CRC detects more errors but uses ~20bytes more program space.
 * Checksum detects less errors.
 * Alternatively you can use TRF_ERROR_CHECKING_NONE to disable error checking altogether.
 * Note: Error checking can only detect if a data was corrupted during transmission.
 * It cannot recover the original data. So you still need to send a message multiple times to 
 * make sure it is received.

 * Data rate presets
 * 
 * Available presets are: TRF_BITRATE_200, TRF_BITRATE_500, TRF_BITRATE_1000, TRF_BITRATE_2000
 * These speeds are estimated speeds, they aren't accurate
 * 
 * According to the datasheet uncalibrated ATtiny13 has 10% frequency error.
 * We also need at least 30us of error margin because we use delayMicroseconds() which isn't super accurate.
 * So if our 0 pulse period is 500 then our error margin is 500-50-30 to 500+50+30
 * In my experience TRF_BITRATE_1000 was a good option with ATtiny13 as TX
 * If you are using an Arduino as TX you can go up to TRF_BITRATE_2000 speed.
 * If you need custom speeds you can define one for yourself in the header file "TinyRF.h"
 *
 * Preabmle:
 * Preabmle to send before each transmission to get the receiver tuned.
 * Increase preabmle if you decrease pulse periods.
 * In my experiments a preabmle of ~50ms was needed (the faster the datarate the more preabmle needed).
 * However Internet suggests much shorter times.

 * Receiver buffer size
 * It's a circular FIFO buffer
 * When buffer is full it will start from the beggining, rewriting data regardless of it being read or not
 * The size of the buffer depends on how much RAM you have available, how big your messages are,
 * how frequently you send them and how frequently you call getReceivedData() in your receiver code
 * Note that when you use sendMulti() all of the messages will be stored in buffer until read with getReceivedData()
 * How to calculate: 
 * minimum buffer size = (message length + 3) * repetition
 * So if you wanna do sendMulti("hello", 5, 2) you're gonna need (5 + 3) * 2 = 16 bytes of buffer

/**
 * [ You probably don't want to change this ]
 * We don't have a specific pulse that signals the end of a transmission. 
 * We rely on 1- noise and 2- message length for that.
 * 1) Message length is sent with each frame but it's susceptible to noise and cannot be trusted 100%.
 * 2) When noise is received in the receiver the transmission is considered over.
 * But in the rare even that you are in a noiseless environment or if you are sending messages 
 * without a delay between them (which allows for noise to cause EOT) this could mean that the 
 * receiver will keep waiting for the next byte of the transmission AND add the next preabmle to current message
 * There are two ways we can fix that
 * 1- Create noise in the TX: i.e. send a bunch of meaningless pulses 
 * 2- Detect end of transmission in RX: i.e. when no data has been received for a while consider 
 * the transmission finished.
 * Solution number 2 has a drawback: we don't use timer interrupt for checking how long there has 
 * been silence, instead we use getReceivedData() for that. So if getReceivedData() is not called 
 * frequently enough we will not be able to detect EOT (this is in case there is no noise and len is curropted)
 * So there are 3 redundant means by which we detect EOT, this means our errors will be rare
 * The default is EOT_IN_RX because we want to minimize the transmitter code size
 * You can uncomment TRF_EOT_IN_TX if you want EOT to be done in transmitter which is more reliable
 * Alternatively you can uncomment TRF_EOT_NONE if you think you don't need this
